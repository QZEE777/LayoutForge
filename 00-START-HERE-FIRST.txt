  MANU2PRINT - COMPLETE STARTUP GUIDE
============================================

This is the ONLY guide you need. Follow these steps in order.

============================================
  STEP 1: Open File Explorer
============================================

  1. On your Desktop or taskbar, click File Explorer (looks like a folder).
  
  2. Type this in the address bar at the top:
     c:\Users\qqfs7\Desktop\layoutforge
     
  3. Press Enter.
  
  You should now see the layoutforge folder and all its files.

============================================
  STEP 2: Run the startup script
============================================

  1. In the layoutforge folder, find the file: START-HERE.bat
     (It will have a small gear icon on it.)
  
  2. Double-click it.
  
  3. A black window will appear. READ WHAT IT SAYS.
  
     It will either:
     
     a) Say "Checking Node.js installation... [OK]"
        → The script will continue. Wait and keep reading the window.
        → It will say "Starting the app server..."
        → It may say "Installing project dependencies..." (takes 1-2 minutes first time)
        → Then it will say "Opening your browser..."
        
     b) Say "[ERROR] Node.js is installed but not accessible"
        → SOLUTION: Restart your PC again
        → After restart, try this guide again from STEP 1
        
     c) Say something else that looks like an error
        → Write down what it says and tell me exactly

============================================
  STEP 3: After the script runs
============================================

  Two things should happen:
  
  a) A SECOND black window appears (titled "LayoutForge Server")
     → DO NOT CLOSE THIS WINDOW
     → Leave it open the whole time you use the app
     → It will show running messages like "Ready in 2.3s"
     
  b) Your browser opens to show LayoutForge
     → The home page should appear with:
        - "LayoutForge" at the top
        - "Professional Manuscript Formatting for KDP"
        - A blue "Upload Manuscript" button
     
     If the browser shows "localhost refused to connect":
     → Close that browser tab
     → Wait 10 more seconds
     → Type this in the address bar: http://127.0.0.1:3000
     → Press Enter

============================================
  STEP 4: You're done! Now you can:
============================================

  1. Click "Upload Manuscript"
  2. Drag or choose a PDF or DOCX file (under 50MB)
  3. Click "Upload & Continue"
  4. See the preview and options
  5. Click "Generate PDF"
  6. Download your file

  While you do this, keep that black "LayoutForge Server" window open.
  When you're finished using the app, you can close it.

============================================
  TROUBLESHOOTING: Common Problems
