  LAYOUTFORGE - HOW TO OPEN THE APP
============================================

Do this once:

  1. Double-click:  START-HERE.bat

  2. Wait. A black window will open (the server). Then your
     browser will open with the app.

  3. Keep the black window OPEN while you use the app.
     If you close it, the app will stop.

  4. When you're done, close the black window.

That's it. You don't need to type anything or run any other program.

============================================
  If the browser says "can't connect"
============================================

  - Wait 15 seconds and press F5 (refresh) in the browser.
  - Or close the browser tab and double-click START-HERE.bat again,
    then wait until the black window shows "Ready" before you use
    the browser.
