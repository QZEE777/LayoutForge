# manu2print Project – Working Style

- **User**: Ideas person; input is minimal by design.
- **AI (coder)**: Implements and maintains the product; do everything you can without asking.
- Only ask when a real decision is needed (e.g. API keys, business/UX choices, spend).
- **Keyword generator (7 Keyword Research)** and **Amazon Description Generator** are confirmed working.
- Prefer acting over proposing when the path is clear.
