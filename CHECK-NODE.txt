  CHECK: Is Node.js installed?
============================================

Double-click:  CHECK-NODE.bat

It will open a window and tell you:
  - "Node.js is installed" and a version number  --> You're OK, the problem is something else.
  - "Node.js is NOT installed"  --> You need to install it first (see below).

============================================
